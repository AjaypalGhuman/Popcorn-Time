![Product Name Screen Shot](./assets/images/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)


## Technologies Used: 
Html, CSS, JQuery, JavaScript.

## How will your Application work?
As the user searches and does research on movie titles, they will receive general information regarding the movie plot, cast, images and movie rating and where to watch.

## Who's planning on working on what?
Abraham & AJ: Javascript and APIs
German & Maria Andrea: HTML and CSS 

## APIs
[Watchmode API]: (https://api.watchmode.com)
[IMDB API]: (https://imdb-api.com)

## CSS Framework: 
Bulma and Foundation

## Concept
As a movie fanatic I want to research movie titles and ratings before purchasing tickets to the theatre or purchasing it online.
I want to make sure that the movie I search for is going to be a fun and thrilling experience. So that I do not waste time and money.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given that I am looking for a movie to watch, when I search for the movie title, then I receive information about the movie, cast, and ratings.
