<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](./assets/images/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

The group will use everything learned over the past six weeks to create a real-world front-end application that youâ€™ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:

- Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

- Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

- Be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input).

- Use at least two server-side APIs.

- Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

- Be responsive.

- Have a polished UI.

- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id-naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

- Finally, You must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 2.

What was done:

- Used Bulma as an alternative to Bootstrap, along with CSS framework.

- Popcorn Time is mobile responsive as the majority of users will use a mobile device to search for movie titles.

- Should there be a title that cannot be found, a modal will alert the user that their search did not have results.

- 

- Popcorn Time interacts with the user by providing the description, cast members, release date of the title selected by the user when using the 'Movie Search' feature. As well as, providing the user the "Where to Whatch" feature, in order for them to select their preferred movie channel, app or subscription.
