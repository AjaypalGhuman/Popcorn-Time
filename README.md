## Features 


#### Top Ten Movies Currently:
Upon entry to the page, the game menu reveals itself with a bouncing down effect from the top of the screen. 
This effect is also applied to the game container itself, which is triggered when the user selects the "start Game " button. 
This was applied with the use of css. 

#### Modals :
Bootstrap modals were used for the tutorial Information,"Correct" and"incorrect" alerts .Within these modals are a "next stage", "preview again" or "restart game " button. The "preview again" button only appears within the modal if you havent selected the "strict Mode" checkbox, otherwise the user is asked to restart the game. 

#### Favorites List:
Audio is triggered by the users onclick, depending on whether or not they have selected the correct pattern previously displayed to them. 




## Features Left to Implement

Search Movies by genre (Comedy, Action, Thriller, etc.)
Recommend Movie Titles by the user mood
Adding location based services to see if a movie is available in a theater near you.

## Challenges
Challenges we faced include, merging each other branches, styling of the content containers, and making the site mobile responsive.

## Successes
Successes include styling of the header and footer of the page and receiving and deploying the API data to the actual website.
