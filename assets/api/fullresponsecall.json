When the carnival's geek becomes ill, owner Clem enlists Stan to help him dispose of the man, and explains that he seeks out alcoholics, who are often men with troubled pasts, and lures them in with promises of a temporary job and gives them opium-laced alcohol. He uses their dependence to create a geek for his carnival.\r\nStan works with the clairvoyant act \"Madame Zeena\" and her alcoholic husband, Pete. Zeena and Pete use cold reading and coded language, which Pete begins teaching to Stan. He and Zeena warn Stan not to use these skills to continue leading patrons on when it comes to the dead. Meanwhile, Stan becomes attracted to fellow performer Molly and approaches her with an idea for a two-person act away from the carnival. One night, Stan gives Pete the wrong bottle, and the old man dies from consuming wood alcohol. Stan and Molly leave the carnival.\r\nTwo years later, Stan has successfully reinvented himself as a psychic act for the wealthy elite of Buffalo, with Molly as his assistant, using Zeena and Pete's techniques. During a performance, their act is interrupted by psychologist Dr. Lilith Ritter, who attempts to expose the act, but Stan bests Ritter. He is later approached by the wealthy Judge Kimball, who employed Ritter to test Stan. Now convinced of Stan's abilities, he offers to pay him to allow him and his wife to communicate with their dead son. Despite Molly's objections, Stan agrees.\r\nRitter invites Stan to her office. Knowing he is a con man, she is intrigued by his skill. Through recorded sessions with her clients, she has accumulated information about members of Buffalo's social elite. She and Stan begin an affair, and conspire to manipulate Kimball, with Ritter providing private information to Stan. She begins therapy sessions with Stan, who reveals his guilt over Pete's death and his hatred of his alcoholic father, who he killed in their home before joining the carnival.\r\nKimball introduces Stan to Ezra Grindle, whose lover, Dory, died of a forced abortion. Despite warnings from Ritter that Grindle is dangerous, Stan begins to scam Grindle and starts to drink. Ritter feeds Stan information to use against Grindle as revenge for him attacking her. Molly becomes uncomfortable, and learning of the affair with Ritter, leaves Stan. He begs her to stay, but she refuses, only agreeing to help him one last time. She poses as Dory for Stan's act: conjuring Dory from afar for Grindle. However, Stan loses control of Grindle, who reveals himself to be a violent abuser of women due to his guilt for Dory, then embracing Molly before she can exit. Grindle's henchman, Anderson, hears a radio broadcast announcing that Judge Kimball and his wife have been found dead in a murder-suicide - because of Stan's promises that they would be reunited with their dead son after death. Anderson goes to check on Grindle.\r\nRealizing \"Dory\" is a fake, Grindle becomes enraged and promises to destroy Stan. Stan beats him to death, then kills Anderson during their escape. Stan trashes their car to make it appear it was stolen, as Molly leaves. Stan goes to Ritter, discovering she has been scamming him. Ritter contacts security and threatens to use her recordings of their sessions as evidence that he is mentally disturbed should he try to implicate her. Ritter shoots Stan in the ear, then he strangles Ritter, but security officers arrive, and he flees.\r\nStan hides in a train and becomes homeless and an alcoholic. He tries to get a job as a mentalist at a carnival. The owner instead offers him a drink and a \"temporary\" job as the new geek. Stan cries and laughs as he accepts the job.\r\nCast\r\nBradley Cooper as Stanton \"Stan\" Carlisle\r\nCate Blanchett as Lilith Ritter\r\nRooney Mara as Mary Margaret \"Molly\" Cahill\r\nToni Collette as Zeena Krumbein\r\nWillem Dafoe as Clement \"Clem\" Hoately\r\nRichard Jenkins as Ezra Grindle\r\nRon Perlman as Bruno\r\nDavid Strathairn as Peter \"Pete\" Krumbein\r\nMark Povinelli as Major Mosquito\r\nMary Steenburgen as Felicia Kimball\r\nPeter MacNeill as Judge Kimball\r\nHolt McCallany as Anderson\r\nPaul Anderson as Geek #1\r\nJim Beaver as Sheriff Jedediah Judd\r\nClifton Collins Jr. as Funhouse Jack\r\nTim Blake Nelson as Carny Boss\r\nDavid Hewlett as Dr. Elrood\r\nLara Jean Chorostecki as Louise Hoately\r\nStephen McHattie as Hobo #1\r\nDian Bachar as Fee Fee the Birdgirl\r\nRomina Power, daughter of actor Tyrone Power who played Stanton in the 1947 film, cameos as a viewer of Stanton's show.\r\nProduction\r\nPre-production\r\nThe project was announced in December 2017, when Guillermo del Toro revealed that he would be attached to write and direct a film adaptation of William Lindsay Gresham's 1946 novel. The film marks a departure for del Toro, as it contains no \"supernatural\" elements, as opposed to his previous films. Del Toro considered this to be a standalone adaptation of Gresham's novel, as opposed to a remake of the 1947 film version starring Tyrone Power. He stated: \"Well what it is is that book was given to me in 1992 by Ron Perlman before I saw the Tyrone Power movie, and I loved the book. My adaptation that I’ve done with Kim Morgan is not necessarily—the entire book is impossible, it's a saga. But there are elements that are darker in the book, and it's the first chance I have—in my short films I wanted to do noir. It was horror and noir. And now is the first chance I have to do a real underbelly of society type of movie. no supernatural elements. Just a straight, really dark story.\" Del Toro also revealed the film would be aiming for an R-rating, saying: \"big R. Double R!\"\r\nIn April 2019, Leonardo DiCaprio entered negotiations to star in the film. Dan Laustsen and Alexandre Desplat were announced to serve as the film's cinematographer and composer, respectively, both having previously collaborated with del Toro in The Shape of Water (2017).\r\nCasting\r\nIn June 2019, Bradley Cooper entered early negotiations to replace DiCaprio. Del Toro stated that he and Cooper quickly connected with each other when del Toro met Cooper in Cooper's house to discuss the role: \"We started talking script and then this started mirroring our thoughts about life and the way we viewed the world. We entered strange, darker times that led to 'Nightmare Alley' for me, and way I view the world.\" Del Toro also believed that Cooper's experience as a director helped strengthen their connection, stating, \"A director is an actor and an actor is a director. There is no separation of the craft...that took awhile for me to get used to. I normally create and guide these little Fabergé eggs of movies, obsessively detailed. All of a sudden we were on an adventure. I will never shoot a movie the same way.\" Del Toro further discussed his collaborative relationship with Cooper while filming:\r\nCuriosity and integrity are the two things, they are very bonded We're like truffle hunters, smelling for that, looking for certain truth, not verisimilitude or realism but truth which is a higher form of telling a story. How we get to it is only through curiosity. When we have collaborators, the main reward is a point of view that you can literally bounce off, or get bounced off, and seek for the truth…I found it a blessing at age 56 in this movie to find the marvel of complicity and curiosity. \"Is this all we can do with that scene, with that shot?\" You keep seeking.\r\nIn August 2019, Cate Blanchett was in negotiations to join the film. Both Cooper and Blanchett were confirmed to star the next month, along with the addition of Rooney Mara. Toni Collette and David Strathairn were added in September, with Strathairn replacing Michael Shannon who dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. Collette praised del Toro's capabilities as a director, and described the film as a \"period drama\" and \"unlike some of his other work.\" Willem Dafoe was cast in October and Holt McCallany would join the next month. Ron Perlman and Richard Jenkins were both confirmed in January 2020. In February 2020, Mary Steenburgen and Romina Power, the daughter of Tyrone Power, joined the cast of the film. In March 2020, Paul Anderson joined the cast of the film.\r\nFilming\r\nPrincipal photography began in January 2020 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Production temporarily moved to Buffalo, New York in February 2020, in order for del Toro to take advantage of the city's architecture and unfamiliar setting: \"I wanted to find a city that was really interesting to visit for an audience, that was not a city they were overtly familiar with.\" Scenes were filmed in and outside of Buffalo's Niagara Square and City Hall, and required the use of fake snow, much to the surprise of the crew, as Buffalo is widely known for its heavy snowfall during the winter season.\r\nPrincipal photography was initially set to begin in September 2019, but was delayed to accommodate Cooper's schedule. \"We shot the second half before the first half,\" Cooper revealed. \"We didn't want to do it that way. Things happened to us, with sets and other actors' availability and water, the snow and all that. I was the cause. I had moved to New York and said, 'I can't do it right now. Let me get settled.'\" In March 2020, Del Toro himself shut down production on the film after rising concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic: \"We stopped the shoot a week before That saved us. Nobody to my knowledge in the cast or the crew got coronavirus.\" Del Toro later reflected that \"Stopping was not mandatory back then, but we both felt if we don't stop now and someone gets sick — we said, 'we gotta stop.' Nobody was expecting it. Everybody went to lunch and came back six months later.\" Searchlight's parent, Walt Disney Studios, officially halted production on the film soon after.\r\nDel Toro revealed that when production was shut down, approximately 45% of the film was shot, and he spent his time editing available footage during the hiatus. Del Toro also composed an 80-page safety precaution guideline to be used when production was to resume, which he was hoping to do in late 2020. Variety reported that Blanchett had completed her scenes prior to the shutdown.\r\nProduction resumed in September 2020 in Toronto. In an interview, Collette discussed some of the film's safety protocols: \" I’ve got to say, I think, you couldn't get any safer than a film set.

Cate Blanchett, Toni Collette, Willem Dafoe, Richard Jenkins, Rooney Mara, Ron Perlman, Mary Steenburgen, and David Strathairn also star.</p><p>Del Toro announced the film in 2017, and produced alongside J. Miles Dale and Cooper. Frequent collaborator Dan Laustsen was the cinematographer, and Nathan Johnson replaced Alexandre Desplat as its composer. Principal photography began in January 2020 in Toronto, Ontario, but was shut down in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Production resumed in September 2020 and concluded that December.</p><p>Nightmare Alley premiered at Alice Tully Hall in New York City on December 1, 2021, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 17, 2021 by Searchlight Pictures. Additionally, a black-and-white version titled Nightmare Alley: Vision in Darkness and Light was released in select cities starting on January 14, 2022. The film received generally positive reviews from critics but underperformed at the box office, grossing a total of $23 million worldwide against a $60 million production budget.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>In 1939, Stanton Carlisle burns down his house after putting a dead body inside and takes a job as a carny. When the carnival's geek becomes ill, owner Clem enlists Stan to help him dispose of the man, and explains that he seeks out alcoholics, who are often men with troubled pasts, and lures them in with promises of a temporary job and gives them opium-laced alcohol. He uses their dependence to create a geek for his carnival.</p><p>Stan works with the clairvoyant act \"Madame Zeena\" and her alcoholic husband, Pete. Zeena and Pete use cold reading and coded language, which Pete begins teaching to Stan. He and Zeena warn Stan not to use these skills to continue leading patrons on when it comes to the dead. Meanwhile, Stan becomes attracted to fellow performer Molly and approaches her with an idea for a two-person act away from the carnival. One night, Stan gives Pete the wrong bottle, and the old man dies from consuming wood alcohol. Stan and Molly leave the carnival.</p><p>Two years later, Stan has successfully reinvented himself as a psychic act for the wealthy elite of Buffalo, with Molly as his assistant, using Zeena and Pete's techniques. During a performance, their act is interrupted by psychologist Dr. Lilith Ritter, who attempts to expose the act, but Stan bests Ritter. He is later approached by the wealthy Judge Kimball, who employed Ritter to test Stan. Now convinced of Stan's abilities, he offers to pay him to allow him and his wife to communicate with their dead son. Despite Molly's objections, Stan agrees.</p><p>Ritter invites Stan to her office. Knowing he is a con man, she is intrigued by his skill. Through recorded sessions with her clients, she has accumulated information about members of Buffalo's social elite. She and Stan begin an affair, and conspire to manipulate Kimball, with Ritter providing private information to Stan. She begins therapy sessions with Stan, who reveals his guilt over Pete's death and his hatred of his alcoholic father, who he killed in their home before joining the carnival.</p><p>Kimball introduces Stan to Ezra Grindle, whose lover, Dory, died of a forced abortion. Despite warnings from Ritter that Grindle is dangerous, Stan begins to scam Grindle and starts to drink. Ritter feeds Stan information to use against Grindle as revenge for him attacking her. Molly becomes uncomfortable, and learning of the affair with Ritter, leaves Stan. He begs her to stay, but she refuses, only agreeing to help him one last time. She poses as Dory for Stan's act: conjuring Dory from afar for Grindle. However, Stan loses control of Grindle, who reveals himself to be a violent abuser of women due to his guilt for Dory, then embracing Molly before she can exit. Grindle's henchman, Anderson, hears a radio broadcast announcing that Judge Kimball and his wife have been found dead in a murder-suicide - because of Stan's promises that they would be reunited with their dead son after death. Anderson goes to check on Grindle.</p><p>Realizing \"Dory\" is a fake, Grindle becomes enraged and promises to destroy Stan. Stan beats him to death, then kills Anderson during their escape. Stan trashes their car to make it appear it was stolen, as Molly leaves. Stan goes to Ritter, discovering she has been scamming him. Ritter contacts security and threatens to use her recordings of their sessions as evidence that he is mentally disturbed should he try to implicate her. Ritter shoots Stan in the ear, then he strangles Ritter, but security officers arrive, and he flees.</p><p>Stan hides in a train and becomes homeless and an alcoholic. He tries to get a job as a mentalist at a carnival. The owner instead offers him a drink and a \"temporary\" job as the new geek. Stan cries and laughs as he accepts the job.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Bradley Cooper as Stanton \"Stan\" Carlisle</li><li>Cate Blanchett as Lilith Ritter</li><li>Rooney Mara as Mary Margaret \"Molly\" Cahill</li><li>Toni Collette as Zeena Krumbein</li><li>Willem Dafoe as Clement \"Clem\" Hoately</li><li>Richard Jenkins as Ezra Grindle</li><li>Ron Perlman as Bruno</li><li>David Strathairn as Peter \"Pete\" Krumbein</li><li>Mark Povinelli as Major Mosquito</li><li>Mary Steenburgen as Felicia Kimball</li><li>Peter MacNeill as Judge Kimball</li><li>Holt McCallany as Anderson</li><li>Paul Anderson as Geek #1</li><li>Jim Beaver as Sheriff Jedediah Judd</li><li>Clifton Collins Jr. as Funhouse Jack</li><li>Tim Blake Nelson as Carny Boss</li><li>David Hewlett as Dr. Elrood</li><li>Lara Jean Chorostecki as Louise Hoately</li><li>Stephen McHattie as Hobo #1</li><li>Dian Bachar as Fee Fee the Birdgirl</li></ul><p>Romina Power, daughter of actor Tyrone Power who played Stanton in the 1947 film, cameos as a viewer of Stanton's show.</p><br/><h3>Production</h3><h4>Pre-production</h4><p>The project was announced in December 2017, when Guillermo del Toro revealed that he would be attached to write and direct a film adaptation of William Lindsay Gresham's 1946 novel. The film marks a departure for del Toro, as it contains no \"supernatural\" elements, as opposed to his previous films. Del Toro considered this to be a standalone adaptation of Gresham's novel, as opposed to a remake of the 1947 film version starring Tyrone Power. He stated: \"Well what it is is that book was given to me in 1992 by Ron Perlman before I saw the Tyrone Power movie, and I loved the book. My adaptation that I’ve done with Kim Morgan is not necessarily—the entire book is impossible, it's a saga. But there are elements that are darker in the book, and it's the first chance I have—in my short films I wanted to do noir. It was horror and noir. And now is the first chance I have to do a real underbelly of society type of movie. no supernatural elements. Just a straight, really dark story.\" Del Toro also revealed the film would be aiming for an R-rating, saying: \"big R. Double R!\"</p><p>In April 2019, Leonardo DiCaprio entered negotiations to star in the film. Dan Laustsen and Alexandre Desplat were announced to serve as the film's cinematographer and composer, respectively, both having previously collaborated with del Toro in The Shape of Water (2017).</p><h4>Casting</h4><p>In June 2019, Bradley Cooper entered early negotiations to replace DiCaprio. Del Toro stated that he and Cooper quickly connected with each other when del Toro met Cooper in Cooper's house to discuss the role: \"We started talking script and then this started mirroring our thoughts about life and the way we viewed the world. We entered strange, darker times that led to 'Nightmare Alley' for me, and way I view the world.\" Del Toro also believed that Cooper's experience as a director helped strengthen their connection, stating, \"A director is an actor and an actor is a director. There is no separation of the craft...that took awhile for me to get used to. I normally create and guide these little Fabergé eggs of movies, obsessively detailed. All of a sudden we were on an adventure. I will never shoot a movie the same way.\" Del Toro further discussed his collaborative relationship with Cooper while filming:</p><blockquote>Curiosity and integrity are the two things, they are very bonded We're like truffle hunters, smelling for that, looking for certain truth, not verisimilitude or realism but truth which is a higher form of telling a story. How we get to it is only through curiosity. When we have collaborators, the main reward is a point of view that you can literally bounce off, or get bounced off, and seek for the truth…I found it a blessing at age 56 in this movie to find the marvel of complicity and curiosity. \"Is this all we can do with that scene, with that shot?\" You keep seeking.</blockquote><p>In August 2019, Cate Blanchett was in negotiations to join the film. Both Cooper and Blanchett were confirmed to star the next month, along with the addition of Rooney Mara. Toni Collette and David Strathairn were added in September, with Strathairn replacing Michael Shannon who dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. Collette praised del Toro's capabilities as a director, and described the film as a \"period drama\" and \"unlike some of his other work.\" Willem Dafoe was cast in October and Holt McCallany would join the next month. Ron Perlman and Richard Jenkins were both confirmed in January 2020. In February 2020, Mary Steenburgen and Romina Power, the daughter of Tyrone Power, joined the cast of the film. In March 2020, Paul Anderson joined the cast of the film.</p><h4>Filming</h4><p>Principal photography began in January 2020 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Production temporarily moved to Buffalo, New York in February 2020, in order for del Toro to take advantage of the city's architecture and unfamiliar setting: \"I wanted to find a city that was really interesting to visit for an audience, that was not a city they were overtly familiar with.\" Scenes were filmed in and outside of Buffalo's Niagara Square and City Hall, and required the use of fake snow, much to the surprise of the crew, as Buffalo is widely known for its heavy snowfall during the winter season.</p><p>Principal photography was initially set to begin in September 2019, but was delayed to accommodate Cooper's schedule. \"We shot the second half before the first half,\" Cooper revealed. \"We didn't want to do it that way. Things happened to us, with sets and other actors' availability and water, the snow and all that. I was the cause. I had moved to New York and said, 'I can't do it right now. Let me get settled.'\" In March 2020, Del Toro himself shut down production on the film after rising concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic: \"We stopped the shoot a week before That saved us. Nobody to my knowledge in the cast or the crew got coronavirus.\" Del Toro later reflected that \"Stopping was not mandatory back then, but we both felt if we don't stop now and someone gets sick — we said, 'we gotta stop.' Nobody was expecting it. Everybody went to lunch and came back six months later.\" Searchlight's parent, Walt Disney Studios, officially halted production on the film soon after.</p><p>Del Toro revealed that when production was shut down, approximately 45% of the film was shot, and he spent his time editing available footage during the hiatus. Del Toro also composed an 80-page safety precaution guideline to be used when production was to resume, which he was hoping to do in late 2020. Variety reported that Blanchett had completed her scenes prior to the shutdown.</p><p>Production resumed in September 2020 in Toronto. In an interview, Collette discussed some of the film's safety protocols: \" I’ve got to say, I think, you couldn't get any safer than a film set. They're so regimented and disciplined and demanding in terms of having to toe the line and everyone does their best to not get it. You really are in a bubble and the whole of Toronto is in masks and you're just sanitizing your hands a million times a day and trying not to be in big crowds and you just have to be mindful of that. Especially when you're working, because there's a bigger risk there. It's not just you, it's everyone else, you know?\" Collette also revealed that del Toro had shot almost four hours of footage. By November 2020, principal photography was completed and re-shoots had commenced. Production officially wrapped in December 2020.</p><p>Del Toro and Cooper reflected that the unexpected shooting schedule benefited the film's structure. Del Toro remarked that “It was a blessing I believe wholeheartedly life gives you what you need, not what you want. You have a window to look at everything. It was incredible. We got to see these characters, when was full of himself and arrogant and certain and seeking. We were able to go back six months in between all this and were able to analyze and see not only that character but what we needed to rewrite to be able to go back to a set. If your pores are open, the movie finds you. Each movie tells you what it needs.” Cooper further stated that “This movie needed that rigor. Thank god we had that time. As simple a story is, it demanded all our concentration and focus, all that time. I don't think we realized how much it demanded of us at the beginning. That was the discovery. There is arrogance. You think you can do it, then, ‘how is this possible?'”</p><p>Cooper further reflected on his relationship with del Toro over the course of filming:</p><blockquote>We Nightmare Alley for the last two and a half years It was a unique experience, going through the pandemic, taking six months off and revisiting it.
